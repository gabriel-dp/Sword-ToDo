## Introduction

This project is part of the work of [SwordFish](https://www.instagram.com/swordfish.vca/) team to the F1 in Schools challenge.

A Web todo list is a alternative more practical and sustainable than the use of hand-writting notes in stickers or notebook sheet, helping a lot the organization of the team.

The team decided to create the own tools to manage tasks and so Sword-ToDo was born.
